' Notes
note right of API
  Handles both synchronous (HTTP)
  and asynchronous (WebSocket)
  communication
end note

note right of AgentSystem
  Dynamic creation and configuration
  of agents based on capabilities
  and tool requirements
end note

note right of WorkflowEngine
  Manages workflow execution
  and state transitions using
  graph-based processing
end note

note right of DataProcessors
  Transforms and processes data
  for storage, caching, and
  real-time updates
end note

note right of Supabase
  Persistent storage for all
  system configurations and
  execution history
end note

note right of Cache
  In-memory storage for
  high-performance access to
  active execution data
end note

note right of EventBus
  Enables asynchronous
  communication between
  system components
end note

note right of ExtServices
  Integration points for
  AI, automation, and
  external tool capabilities
end note
